We believe learning should be [open-knowledge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_knowledge). To us this means:

- [open-source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source): The software that powers open-learning should be free as in speech and developed in an open and collaborative manner.
- [open-communication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_communication): The services that powers open-learning should be available for access and integration on an equal basis.
- [open-content](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_content): Everyone should be free to retain, reuse, revise, remix and redistribute open-learning content.
- [open-data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data): All data generated on the open-learning platform should be freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish.
