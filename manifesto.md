The way we facilitate learning has not really changed much since the [Platonic Academy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_Academy), but with the help of technology we're starting to see truly disruptive [ed-tech](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edtech) innovations like the transition from printed books to digital interactions and the launch of [MOOC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course) platforms that are changing the way we think about future of learning - constantly expanding our horizons and challenging our imagination of what is possible.

We want to accelerate this further and power future innovations by developing the technologies and best-practices for the first open learning platform and then establish the first community owned and operated open learning ecosystem. An ecosystem like this will lower some of the most common barriers of entry - cost of technology and user aquisition to near zero while at the same time providing a tried and scalable platform for the next-generation of ed-tech innovators to build their innovations on.

We believe that once this ecosystem is in place we can, and should, enable *anyone* in the world with basic internet access and the passion to learn the ability to participate, thus *really* changing our future of fammilies, communities and countries by giving them the fundamental skills needed to compete as equals in a global economy. 

# Open

We are strong believers of the open-source development model and we believe a public learning ecosystem should be built on the foundation of [open-knowledge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_knowledge). To us this means:

- [open-source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source): The software that powers learning should be free as in speech and developed in an open and collaborative manner.
- [open-communication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_communication): The services that powers learning should be available to access and integrate with on an equal basis.
- [open-content](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_content): Everyone should be free to retain, reuse, revise, remix and redistribute learning content.
- [open-data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data): Data generated as the result of learning should be freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish.

# Transparency and Trust

As with open-source where you can inspect the source of your software and trace its origins we want give users of our ecosystem access to the atomic components of their learning experience. This creates a trust model that combined with certification will provide a [claims based identity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claims-based_identity) for learning. We believe this model is supperior to the current one where we trust the issuing institution of a certificate (a university) rather then the individuals who create learning materials (authors) and perform certification (teachers).

# Libre

To us it's important to not only provide a public ecosystem for learning and its technical building blocks, but also to allow anyone to participate in this ecosystem on their own terms. To enable this we give students the ability to pick the content and teachers he or she wants to reach his or her individual learning goals. In addition to this the student should be able allow any third-party institution or system granular access to his or her learning experience in order to provide value-added services such as guidance and performance tracking.
