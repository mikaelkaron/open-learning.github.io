# What

We believe learning should be [libre](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libre_(word)) and [open-knowledge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_knowledge). To us this means:

- [open-source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source): The software that powers open-learning should be free as in speech and developed in an open and collaborative manner.
- [open-communication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_communication): The services that powers open-learning should be available for access and integration on an equal basis.
- [open-content](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_content): Everyone should be free to retain, reuse, revise, remix and redistribute open-learning content.
- [open-data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data): All data generated on the open-learning platform should be freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish.

# Why

Looking at open-source history we there are three key moments that we believe changed the course of the future for open-source:

- The initial publication of the [GNU GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html) - the first open-source license that gave developers legal protection for their contributions.
- The launch of [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/) - the first open-source platform that let developers publish their open-source projects.
- The launch of [GitHub](https://github.com/) - the first open-source platform that let developers collaborate on open-source projects.

Similarly we find some paradigm shifting moment in learning:

- The switch to e-learning from traditional book publishing - significantly lowering the cost and increasing the potential reach of content distribution while enabling new learning experiences.
- The launch of [OpenCourseWare (OCW)](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm) - the first [massive open online course](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course) platform by [MIT](http://mit.edu).

But what we believe is still missing is an **open ecosystem of content and services where instructors and learners can collaborate transparently with trust**, and this is what open-learning provides.

# How

Just do it!
